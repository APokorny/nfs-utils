Template: nfs-kernel-server/tcpwrappers-mountd
Type: note
Description: in /etc/hosts.{allow,deny}, replace "rpc.mountd" with "mountd"
 Older versions of nfs-kernel-server included a mount daemon that
 called itself "rpc.mountd".  The current mount daemon, however, calls
 itself just plain "mountd".
 .
 Therefore, you should replace all occurrences of "rpc.mountd" with
 "mountd" in /etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny.
